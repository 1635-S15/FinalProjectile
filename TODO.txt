# FinalProjectile

[x] ask Piazza question about DisplayServer requirements 
[x] ask Shah if she's covering SRS doc in lecture
[s] ask Shah if we need separate requirements for subclasses 

REQUIREMENTS

[c] add GV requirements to Word template doc
[c] write requirements for 
	[c] VehicleController
	    [c] UserController
	[c] Simulator
	[c] Control
	[c] Projectile

PROJECTILE

[c]] copy over reusable code from GroundVehicle


GROUNDVEHICLE
 
[c]]] loosen restrictions on velocity and make everything slower



DISPLAYSERVER

[s]]] softcode display and simulation coordinate system 
	[ ] display coordinate system 
	[ ] simulation coordinate system defined in Simulator
	    [ ] VC classes access this for wall avoidance
[s] get key press event information and pass it to Simulator
[ ]] display scores
[ ]]] display projectiles
	[ ] projectiles same color as UC
[ ] GV display
	[ ] each UC has indiv. color 
	[ ] FC different color
	[ ] LC different color


USERCONTROLLER
 
[ ] fields for scores
[ ] method for incrementing score counter when things get shot
[ ]]] integrate key press events with velocity control


SIMULATOR

[ ]] transition LC into FC when shot
[ ]] remove FC when shot second time
[ ]] death when crash into wall?
[ ]]] death after collision with GV?
[ ]]] scoring system

NETWORKING

[ ] ???
